## Battery Calibration

1. Charge your phone to 100% without interruption.

2. Discharge your phone fully until it turns itself off (never connect the charger)

3. Turn your phone on a few times to confirm its actually at 0% charge and quickly turnsoff

4. Plug your phone into the charger and, without turning it on, let it charge until the on-screen or LED indicators says 100%

5. Turn on the phone and see that the phone is at 100%, keep the charger connected as long as is needed to reach 100%
