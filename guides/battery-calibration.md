1. Charge your phone to 100% without interruption.

2. Discharge your phone fully until it turns itself off (never connect the charger)

4. Plug your phone into the charger and, without turning it on, let it charge until the on-screen or LED indicators says 100%

5. Turn on the phone and see that the phone is at 100%, keep the charger connected as long as is needed to reach 100%
